It is too simple.

1. Select a 'MODE' from the menu. 
   To navigate, use arrow keys, the vi keys (j ,k , m ), or ENTER .
   TAB (or 'l') moves you to the next window.

2. Most modes requires to select a namespace from the the 'Schemas' listbox. 
   Arrows, vi keys, ENTER (or SPACE ) seals the selection. 
   TAB (or 'l') moves you to the botton window.

3. The results are displayed in the bottom window. 
   Keep pressing 'p' for more screens and more results. 
   TBB (or 'l') takes you back to the starting menu.

4. Press 'q' to quit the program

The main purpose of Pcurse is to run in a terminal, and
not in a terminal emulator. It does work under Xorg with xterm,
and emulators, but some (like rxvt) refuse to display
the results after pressing 'd'.

Thank you for flying Pcurse!
